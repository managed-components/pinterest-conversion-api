## ⚙️ Tool Settings

> Settings are used to configure the tool in a Component Manager config file

#### Ad Account ID `string` _required_

`ad_account_id`: The Pinterest Ad Account ID serves as the unique identifier for your Pinterest Ad Account. It must be 18 characters or fewer. You can locate it when generating a Conversion API Token, displayed on the same screen. [Learn more](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/the-pinterest-api-for-conversions).

#### Conversion Token `string` _required_

`conversion_token`: The Pinterest conversion token is required to access the Coversion API endpoint and can be generated through Ads Manager. Review the [Conversions Guide](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/conversions/conversions/) for more details.

## ⚙️ Fields Description

Fields are properties that can/must be sent with certain events.

### Required Fields

#### Event Name `string` _required_

`event_name` Pinterest's Event Name property should be holding the event name. In this implementation, the event name will be set to 'page_visit' for a pageview event type. In case of 'event' event type, Pinterest is allowing a limited set of events: 'custom', 'lead','search', 'signup', 'view_category' and 'watch_video'. You should make sure to use these exact naming conventions as values of `payload.name`. This MC will automatically assign the value into `event_name` when you do so. For 'ecommerce' event types, see ecommerce section below. For example, in WebCM, webcm.track('event', {name: 'signup'}) will result in sending `event_name: 'signup'` to Pinterest.

#### Action Source `string` _required_

`action_source` Pinterest's Action Source is indicating the source where the conversion event occurred. This MC sets it to `web` by deafault, unless `payload.action_source` is holding a different value. Pinterest allows one of the following values: app_android, app_ios, web, offline.

#### Event ID `string` _required_

`event_id` Pinterest's Event ID is a unique id string that identifies a certain event and can be used for deduping between events ingested via both the conversion API and Pinterest tracking. This MC is looking for values under `payload.event_id` or `payload.ecommerce.event_id` and if it cannot find one, it generates a rundom ID.

#### Client IP Address `string` _required_

`client_ip_address` Pinterest's Client IP Address is the user's IP address, which can be either in IPv4 or IPv6 format. This MC is automatically extracting it from the Client, unless `payload.client_ip_address` is sent, in which case it will override the original value. Note, It is required that you send at least one of `em` `hashed_maids`, or pair `client_ip_address + client_user_agent`.

#### Client User Agent `string` _required_

`client_user_agent` Pinterest's Client User Agent is the user agent string of the user's web browser. This MC is automatically extracting it from the Client, unless `payload.client_user_agent` is sent, in which case it will override the original value. Note, It is required that you send at least one of `em` `hashed_maids`, or pair `client_ip_address + client_user_agent`.

### Optional Fields

#### Event Source Url `string` _optional_

`event_id` Pinterest's Event ID is the URL of the web conversion event. Automatically generated by this MC but can be overriden by passing a value in `payload.event_source_url`.

#### Opt Out `boolean` _optional_

`opt_out` When 'action_source' is web or offline, it defines whether the user has opted out of tracking for web conversion events. While when 'action_source' is app_android or app_ios, it defines whether the user has enabled Limit Ad Tracking on their iOS device, or opted out of Ads Personalization on their Android device. This MC sets the value to False, unless the value of `payload.opt_out` is set to true.

#### Wifi `boolean` _optional_

`wifi` The wifi property holds information of wifi usage. It should be set to true if the event occured when the user device was connected to wifi.

## Ecommerce

Pinterest allows sending the following types of ecommerce properties: `currency`, `value`, `content_ids`, `content_name`, `content_category`, `content_brand`, `contents` (which is an array of object, each one holding `contents.id`, `contents.price` and `contents.quantity`) `num_items`, and `order_id`. You can see their definitions [here](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#operation/events/create), under data > custom data section.

Pinterest is accepting the two ecommerce events: add_to_cart and checkout. This MC therefore, supports the following types of Ecommerce events:

1. Product Added
2. Order Completed

You should use exactly these naming conventions and send them as the `name` property for ecommerce to work. Together with each one, you can send the following properties:

1. `revenue`, `total` or `value` (the MC will first look for `revenue` and if not found, `total`, and then `value`) and will send it via the Pinterest `value` parameter.
2. `products` - an array of products and their details, will be map to the relevant parameters that start with `content_` or the `contents` array.
3. `quantity`, will be mapped to Pinterest's `num_items`. If `quantity` is not specified the MC will look for the quantity of each product object inside `products`, and will add them.

So for example, in WebCM the following snippet:

```javascript
webcm.track('ecommerce', {
  name: 'Order Completed',
  order_id: '1234',
  total: 30.0,
  revenue: 25.0,
  shipping: 3,
  tax: 2,
  coupon: 'winter-sale',
  currency: 'USD',
  products: [
    {
      product_id: '1111product',
      sku: '1234',
      name: 'Shorts',
      price: 10,
      quantity: 2,
      category: 'shorts',
    },
    {
      product_id: '2222product',
      sku: '5678',
      name: 'T-shirt',
      price: 5,
      quantity: 2,
      category: 'T-shirts',
    },
  ],
})
```

Will result in sending these Event Properties:

- `value`: `25.0`
- `quantity`: `4`
- `contents`: `[{id: '1111product',item_price: 10,quantity: 2},{id: '2222product', item_price: 5, quantity: 2}]`
